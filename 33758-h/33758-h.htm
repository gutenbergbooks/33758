<h2>TALE OF THE CHE-CHA-KO</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Che-cha-ko arrived from London Town<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wearing a sort of superior frown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Registered, "Bellingham-Bolingbroke-Browyne"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Hyphenating himself in the middle).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He carried of "boxes" just twenty-four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voted the country "A beastly boah";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed at the "shops," which he roundly swore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Weren't worth a Ta-ra-diddle!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He purchased of farm lands some sections six,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said: "With those common fawmahs I shan't mix!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he started in with his La-de-dah tricks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And built him a "Countwy Seat."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, a "country seat" in this western land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is top rail of a fence, or a pile of sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Che-cha-ko's daily, diurnal demand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was, "The best people I must meet."<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They met him half way, for they cleaned him out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drank his "extra dry" every ball and rout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His poor working-man neighbour he called "a lout,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And laughed at the "countwy daunce."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His amazement was great to learn we "digged wells";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, "We don't do it around Bow Bells";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, describing the life of the London swells,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sighed: "Pore devils! you haven't a chaunce!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He played "Gentleman Fawmah" a year or two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cash was all spent (his friends went too)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he wanted to "borrow a few<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pounds" from his own hired man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the rough fellow said, "My London Cock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you learn to work, quit your bally talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll float your Ship-of-State off th' rock!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(And he winked, did the hired man.)<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He considered the matter, did B. B. Browyne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quit every reference to "Deah London Town,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his neighbour, "the Lout," why, he came right down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And did what we all expected:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lent B. B. seed-grain for his season's crop;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said: "Hang on, m' Boy, y'll come out on top."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did. The Che-cha-ko never cried "stop"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till for parliament he was elected!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So down at Ottawa now he sits<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where he spits and smokes, and smokes and spits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In government circles he splendidly fits,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he's known as "Bully Boy Brown"!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was a man that took his chance&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He got right down to his Song-and-Dance&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let out "London Pride" with his workman's lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tried the smile instead of the frown.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the "Browyne" who would win out in the west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the Brown with common sense that's blest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves "Grandpa" at home with the Family crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Puts hand to the plow; and then&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows the furrow as straight as a die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stout heart, steady hand, with a watchful eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll come to his own, and I'll tell you why:&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The west is calling for MEN!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the year ninety-eight arrived per Dawson stage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In December, a lady, a maid, and a page;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One clearly of rank. With the air of a queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stepped up to the desk, asking: "Pray, have you seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. Marmaduke Montague-Marlinford-Dunne?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adding proudly,&mdash;"The gentleman, Sir, is my son."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nobody knew him&mdash;worse, nobody cared&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Warn't he a pardner of Billy Bird's brother?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I'll describe him, good sirs," said the lady in tears:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His hair, sunny gold, is inclined to up-curl&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His complexion is peach-like&mdash;he's fair as a girl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has large, soulful eyes, they are beaming and kind,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soft, bird-like voice&mdash;and an artistic mind.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

<span class="i0">A de-lightful manner, with most restful air:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! prithee, good gentlemen, find me my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom all London once knew as '<span class="smcap">The dashing Beau-Dunne</span>!'"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lady was weeping in 'kerchief of lace<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A be-whiskered, a pimple-pocked tough to his ears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His jeans all in tatters, his muck-a-lucks worn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His parka was dirty, and mud-splashed and torn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His greeting: "<span class="smcap">Wow! hand out a hootch! durn my gizzard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hollers: "Windy, ol' cock! can YOU call t' y'r mind<br /></span>

<h2>MY SONG</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I could not sing unless my song<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had in its symphony one broken string;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not say the thoughts that in me rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unless my heart had been a broken thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why is it that the voice of Song so yields<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mute music till the heart hath bled?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should we find most fair and far-off fields<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By thorny by-paths led?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if this little weakling song of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Might carry cheer to one, lone, grieving soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most gladly would I offer Hope's bright wine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, smiling, drink the lees left in the bowl:<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For I have in the darkness found some light,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some sunshine seen in shadowed evening hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have found throughout the lonely night<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some perfumed breathings from wild garden bowers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I were ingrate not to send it on,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such echo of what music in me lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it may bring to some o'er darkened dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The brightening glow that comes with morning skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, go you, little broken Song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And carry to some heart in bitter pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only my lute's light laughter. Make thou strong<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The weak of heart and bid them smile again.<br /></span>
